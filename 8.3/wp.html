            The domestic cat [1][2] (felis catas [2]) or Felis silvestris catus [4], informally Felis domesticus [6][7]
            is a small, usually furry ,domesticated, carnivorous mammal. It is often called the housecat when kept as an
            indoor pet,[8] or simply the cat when there is no need to distinguish it from other felids and felines. Cats
            are valued by humans for companionship and ability to hunt vermin and household pests. They are primarily
            nocturnal. [9]

            Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with stron, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp
            retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. As crepuscular predators, cats use their acute
            hearing and ability to see in near darkness to locate prey. Not only can cats hear sounds too faint for
            human ears, they can also hear sounds higher in frequency than humans can perceive. This is because the
            usual prey of cats (particulary rodents such as mice) Make high frequency noises, so the hearing of the cat
            has evolved to pinpoint these faint high-pitched sounds. Cats also have a much better sense of smell than
            humans
